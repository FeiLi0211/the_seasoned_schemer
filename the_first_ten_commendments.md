# The First Ten Commandments

## The First Commandment
When recurring on a list of atoms, lat, ask two questions about it: **(null? lat)** and **else**.

When recurring on a number, n, ask two questions about it: **(zero? n)** and **else**.

When recurring on a list of S-expressions, l, ask tree questions about it: **(null? l)**, **(atom? (car l))**, and **else**.

## The Second Commendment
Use **cons** to build lists.

## The Third Commendment
When building a list, describe the first typical element, and then **cons** it onto the natural recursion.

## The Fourth Commendment
Always change at least one argument while recurring.

When recurring on a list of atoms, lat, use **(cdr lat)**.

When recurring on a number, n, use **(sub1 n)**.

And When recurring on a list of S-expressions, l, use **(car l)** and **(cdr l)** if neither **(null? l)** nor **(atom? (car l))** are true.

It must be changed to be closer to termination. 
The changing argument must be tested in the termination condition:

* When using **cdr**, test termination with **null?** and
* When using **sub1**, test termination with **zero?**.

## The Fifth Commendment
When building a value with **+**, always use **0** for the value of the terminating line, for adding 0 does not change the value of an addition.

When building a value with **â•³**, always use **1** for the value of terminating line, for multiplying by 1 does not change the value of a multiplication.

When building a value with **cons**, always consider **()** for the value of the terminating line.

## The Sixth Commendment
Simplify only after the function is correct.

## The Seventh Commendment
Recur on the subparts that are of the same nature:

* On the sublists of a list.
* On the subexpressions of an arithmetic expression.

## The Eight Commendment
Use help functions to abstract from representations.

## The Ninth Commendment
Abstract common patterns with a new function.

## The Tenth Commendment 
Build functions to collect more than one value at a time.
